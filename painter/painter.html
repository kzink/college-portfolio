<h2>Program Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
This is an OpenGL program designed to a be a simple drawing application.  Lines are drawn by using
the mouse.  The color and the width of the line can be adjusted.  In addition,
lines can be selected, moved, and deleted after their original creation, adding a flavor 
of customization.  The drawing panel can also be saved to a flat-file database, which makes clever
use of space-saving techniques.
