<h1>Technical Writing Projects</h1>

<div class='w3-include-html' w3-include-html="../navbar.html"></div>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
<p>This section is devoted to the projects I completed in my technical writing class.  I have chosen to
include these in my portfolio because they demonstrate my writing and leadership abilities, even though
they are not related to programming.</p>  

<p>During this class, we completed two large group projects, among some some other smaller, individual
projects.  What follows is a description of the projects and role in the team.  The original  
MS word .doc files for each project are also available in the links below.</p>
</div>

<h2>My Role in the Team</h2>
<div class="gentry">
<p>My team for these projects was created by our instructor, who grouped us based on our major.  So,
my group was composed of computer science students - none of whom I knew prior to the class.</p>

<p>Since all of our projects were writing, we each did a portion of the writing.  Ideally, we all would
do an equal portion, but that did not occur very frequently.  I would estimate that I did probably 50% of
the workload, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Leadership of our group was decided when our group was created.  I was not the group leader, at this
time. However, after a few days work on our first project, it became apparent that our leader was not
reliable. Although he was exceedingly smart, he frequently missed group meetings and did not complete
work by our set deadlines.  Thus, I emerged as our new group leader.  We were behind schedule on our
first project, but with a little motivation and hard work, we were able to finish the project on time
and consequently receive the highest grade in the class on this project, as well as every other project.
</p>

<p>As group leader, I attempted to motivate my groupmates by implementing some of the positive strategies
I read in Dale Carnegie's 
<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671723650/qid=1096574922/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-1686934-1447902?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">"How to Win Friends and Influence People."</a></i> 
Specifically, instead of pointing out flaws in someone's work directly, I would take a more constructive
approach: "Your work on _________ is really great, and it could be even better if you did ________."
Another approach I used was sympathizing with my teammates.  After they told me what they disliked or
hated about the project, and I agreed with them, they were much more willing to do the work.</p>

<h2>The Projects</h2>

<div class="gentry">
<h2 class="flush"><a href="project1.doc">Computer Programming Library Manual</a></h2> 
<p>The goal of this project was to create a manual on how to use the UNO library for up-and-coming 
computer science students.  This project details the user on what books to look for in the library,
how to use the UNO computer system, and an interview with one of the instructors from UNO.</p>

<h2 class="flush"><a href="project3.rtf">Hard Drive Installation Manual</a></h2>
<p>This project was created to simulate a step-by-step manual for installing a hard drive into a computer.
The manual contains very rigorous and specific instructions, including pictures, warnings, hazards, and
other details.</p>
