<h2>Program Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
<p>This program was created to administer an exam.  It is constructed around the principles of
inheritence and polymorphism.  The program can display three types of questions: multiple choice, 
true or false, and short answer.</p>

<p>Each question type inherits basics properties from a parent
class (specifically, the question, itself, and its weight).  Of course, each type of question has
distinct properties; for instance, multiple choice questions give the test taker a selection of answers.  
To properly model the nuances of each question type, I used <i>abstract</i> methods. This enabled me 
to handle displaying the question and accepting and validating the user's answer polymorphically, and
it was consequently much easier.</p>
