<h2>Program Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
This program was created to interface with my 
<a href="../blackjack-telnet/blackjack.php">Blackjack telnet server</a>.  
Once launched and connected to the server, it proceeds to play blackjack autonomously through 
the use of regular expression pattern matching and packet generation.  The autoplayer's 
AI is derived from a table, which depicts when it should hit, stand, double, etc.  
based on card counting and the money it has available.  The autoplayer can even be designated 
to quit when it has lost or earned a certain amount of cash.  At the end each round, the 
autoplayer reports its findings regarding the various aspects of the game that it tracks.
