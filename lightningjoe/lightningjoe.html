<h1>Linux - Debian Box</h1>

<?php

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
<p> This was a project I undertook to create my own linux box running Debian.  I created this
Box to further my own application development and understanding of linux systems.  It is currently
hosting multiple servers, including apache, MYSQL, FTP, and SSH.  Likewise, it is hosting this 
portfolio, as well as some other web-based applications I have created.</p>

<p> Another service my linux box provides is internet connection sharing through the use of 
ipchains managed by a program called ipkungfu.  I have found linux internet connection sharing to 
be much more stable than windows-based connection sharing.</p>

<p>I put together this linux box with some parts from an older computer.  It's running on an
Athlon 1.4ghz, which I thought was reasonable fast, so the box has been aptly nicknamed 
"Lightning Joe."</p>
