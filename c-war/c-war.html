<h2>Program Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
This program simulates the playing of the card game War through random number generation.  The
game plays itself (no interaction from the user), and the results of the game are printed to the
screen.  The deck of cards is modeled by using a self-made queue constainer struct that has all
of the basic operations of the STL queue container, including the ability to grow dynamically.
At runtime, the "deck" is a queue is filled with the numbers 0 through 52 in random order.  Then,
the contents of the queue are "dealt" to the two player queues.  Every card from the player
queues are compared against each other to simulate the playing of War.  Each number corresponds to a specific
card through the use of two handy #define statements and card index arrays.
