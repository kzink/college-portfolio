<h2>Program Description</h2>
<div class="gentry">
The virtual page table is a program that simulates, as the name indicates, a virtual page table.  
At runtime, the user indicates how large the page table is, how large each page table entry is, and a
test file to read input from.  
The test file contains a listing of PIDs and memory addresses.  
As the PID's and memory addresses are read in, they are added as entries in the page table--unless
they have already been entered, in which case a "hit" has occurred and no entry is created.  
However, when the page table is full of entries, and a new one must be created, a replacement algorithm is 
implemented.  At runtime, the user gets to choose which algorithm: least recently used or 
first in first out.  Each algorithm has its strengths and its weaknesses, as is evident from 
the program's results.
